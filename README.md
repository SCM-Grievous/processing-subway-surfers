# Subway Surfers (Processing Edition)
By *Nathan Moore*

An adaptation of the popular runner game Subway Surfers, made entirely in Processing.

This project represents a recreation of Subway Surfers, using 3D rendering with OpenGL, audio processing, animation, and custom obstacle models.
Bugs, errors, and crashes may occur.

## Getting Started
Run `main()` method in `SSApp` class to launch the game. External libraries may be required (links coming soon).

Use 'A' and 'D' keys to move, 'Space' to jump.

>[!NOTE]
>When launching the game on Windows, automatic window resizing may occur.  This is external to Processing and occurs when using 3D rendering. No known fixes have been found or are planned for this project.
